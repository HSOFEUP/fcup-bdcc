# Relevant Information
This Big Data Challenge homework is split into two Jupyter Notebooks, as follows:

1. Sample
In this notebook we have executed both visualization tasks as well as machine learning tasks on a 1M entries sample. This is to be the first deliverable to be read. 

1. Full
In this notebook, we have executed only the visualization and statistics tasks on the complete dataset, and not the ML tasks, this is explained more thoroughly in the notebook itself. This deliverable includes videos and figures taken from the distributed environment in which we ran our experiments.


Both notebooks were exported to html but the `.ipynb` version is also attached and ready to run. 

### Additional Datasets
We have used the ADMISSIONS and CAREGIVERS datasets in addition to the default events.
